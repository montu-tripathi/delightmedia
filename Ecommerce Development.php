                        <p class="title-sub-text">If you are one of those local business that operate physically such as
                            a furniture shop or a big local pharmacy, itâ€™s obvious that you may downplay the
                            significance of having your own website. The misconception is that websites are mostly
                            operated by tech and marketing businesses if they business is small or medium. We want you
                            to come out of this mindset and for that we have brought you our side of information as to
                            why you actually do need a website.</p>

                            <li style="color:blue;"><strong> Online Presence Equals More Credibility :</strong></li>

                            <p>In India, whenever a potential client spots your website, he directly correlates to
                                having strong business credibility. A small business having its own e-commerce website
                                is seen as being ambitious and being inclined to provide a high quality service. To put
                                in other words, having your own e-commerce website is going to act as a strong marketing
                                tool for your business.</p>

                            <li style="color:blue;"><strong> Online Presence Equals More Customers :</strong></li>

                            <p>Physical business can handle only a limited amount of customers at a time. Having an
                                e-commerce business on the other hand is a massive advantage when your online presence
                                can handle clients multi-fold as compared to a physical business. Naturally, this
                                increases the number of transactions per unit time and you are set to gain a lot more
                                than you could have had with an offline business.</p>
